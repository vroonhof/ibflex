=========================================================
Python parser for Interactive Brokers Flex XML statements
=========================================================

.. note::

   **This is a maintained fork of** `csingley/ibflex <https://github.com/csingley/ibflex>`_.

   The original package on PyPI (v0.15) was last updated in January 2021 and
   crashes on modern Interactive Brokers Flex reports. ``ibflex2`` ships
   continuously updated dataclasses, an opt-in mode for IBKR's frequent
   schema additions, and security and quality hardening.

   Install with ``pip install ibflex2``.

----

``ibflex2`` converts Interactive Brokers Flex XML brokerage statement data
into typed Python objects, so it can be processed and analyzed in scripts,
notebooks, and pipelines.

*This module is for reading IBKR brokerage reports — it does not place
trades.*

Supports Python 3.9-3.13. The parser has no required dependency beyond
`defusedxml <https://pypi.org/project/defusedxml/>`_; the optional
``client`` for fetching Flex statements depends on
`requests <https://pypi.org/project/requests/>`_ (install ``ibflex2[web]``).

Why this fork
=============

* Parses the **current** IBKR Flex XML format. Many fields and several whole
  sections (e.g. ``StockGrantActivity``) added since 2021.
* Opt-in **unknown-attribute tolerance** so brand-new IBKR fields don't
  raise. See `Tolerance`_ below.
* **Security**: parses XML through ``defusedxml`` to guard against XXE,
  billion-laughs, and external-entity attacks.
* **Maintained tooling**: ``pyproject.toml``, ``ruff``, ``mypy``,
  ``pytest`` matrix on Linux/macOS/Windows × Python 3.9-3.13. Coverage gate
  at 95% (currently 100% on every module except ``utils.py``).
* **Schema-drift CI**: a weekly job scrapes the IBKR Activity Flex Query
  Reference and opens a tracking issue when fields appear that aren't
  declared in ``ibflex.Types``.

If the original ``csingley/ibflex`` package resumes releases, this fork
will be retired. See `CHANGELOG.md <CHANGELOG.md>`_ for what's changed.

Installation
============
::

    pip install ibflex2          # parser only
    pip install ibflex2[web]     # parser + flexget download client


Flex Parser
===========
``ibflex.parser`` parses Flex-format XML data into a hierarchy of Python
objects whose structure matches the original Flex statements, with values
converted to Python types (``datetime.datetime``, ``decimal.Decimal``, etc.)

.. code:: python

    from ibflex import parser

    response = parser.parse("2025-01_ibkr.xml")
    # or:
    response = parser.parse(xml_bytes)

    statement = response.FlexStatements[0]
    for trade in statement.Trades:
        print(f"{trade.tradeDate} {trade.buySell.name} "
              f"{abs(trade.quantity)} {trade.symbol} @ {trade.tradePrice} "
              f"{trade.currency}")

Every Flex section is exposed as a ``Tuple`` of dataclass instances, e.g.
``statement.OpenPositions``, ``statement.CashTransactions``,
``statement.Trades``. See ``ibflex/Types.py`` for every field on every
dataclass.

Tolerance
=========
IBKR adds new attributes to existing Flex sections regularly. To avoid
``FlexParserError`` when a brand-new attribute appears in your reports,
opt into tolerance mode:

.. code:: python

    from ibflex import parser

    # Process-wide:
    parser.enable_unknown_attribute_tolerance()
    response = parser.parse("recent_report.xml")
    parser.disable_unknown_attribute_tolerance()

    # Or scope-limited (recommended):
    with parser.unknown_attribute_tolerance():
        response = parser.parse("recent_report.xml")

Unknown attributes and unknown element types are silently skipped. Known
attributes still parse normally. The flag is module-global and **not
thread-safe**; use a single tolerance setting per process or guard with
locking if needed.

If you find an unknown attribute that should be recognized, please open a
new-field issue with the IBKR field name and an example XML snippet.

Flex report configuration
=========================
Configure Flex statements through `Interactive Brokers account management
<https://gdcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/sso/Login>`_:
Reports > Flex Queries > Custom Flex Queries > Configure.

You can configure whatever you like and ``ibflex2`` should parse it, with
these caveats:

* Use ISO-8601 date format (``yyyy-MM-dd``) or the default ``yyyyMMdd``.
  European-style ``dd/MM/yyyy`` is not supported.
* Use a delimiter between dates and times. The default semicolon is fastest
  to process.
* For Trades, do **not** select the top options "Symbol Summary",
  "Asset Class", or "Orders". (You can check the "Asset Class" box further
  down in the XML attribute list — that's fine.)


Flex Client
===========
Once you've defined Flex queries, you can generate an access token under
Reports > Settings > FlexWeb Service. With the token and the query ID
you can download statements over HTTP:

.. code:: python

    from ibflex import client, parser

    statement_xml = client.download(token="111111111111111111111111",
                                    query_id="111111")
    response = parser.parse(statement_xml)

You can also run the bundled ``flexget`` script::

    flexget -t 111111111111111111111111 -q 111111 > 2025-01_ibkr.xml

The client retries on transient ``Server busy`` (5 s backoff) and
``Throttled`` (10 s backoff) responses, and raises
``StatementGenerationTimeout`` after ``max_tries`` (default 5).

Development
===========

With Nix (matches CI exactly)::

    nix develop
    pytest --cov=ibflex --cov-fail-under=95 tests/
    mypy ibflex tests
    ruff check ibflex tests

Without Nix::

    pip install -e .[web,dev]
    pytest tests/
    mypy ibflex tests
    ruff check ibflex tests

See `CONTRIBUTING.md <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ for the new-field workflow,
fixture conventions, and release process.
